# SimpleUsefulTimer

**As of June 2025 I am re-developing this app to make it cross platform using the wonderful [Qt platform](https://www.qt.io/). Stay tuned! ETA: Before GTA VI**
====================================================================================
**I made this timer with ease of use and simplicity in mind. Default settings shown in the picture.**

**Program Features and Behavior:**
- Two functions: Start/Stop (Toggle) and Reset
- Always stays on top of other programs
- Hotkeys are global and non-blocking
- Easy configuration and auto-saving functionality

**Downsides**
Not cross platform, sorry!

Please feel free to report any bugs and leave any feedback / code reviews.

To run this app smoothly please [ensure you have .NET 8 installed](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-8.0.10-windows-x64-installer) on your PC
