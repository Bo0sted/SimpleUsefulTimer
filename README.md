# SimpleUsefulTimer

**Update June 2025: I am beginning the re-development of this application on the Qt framework this way there will be one unified version that works on both Windows and Linux**

**I made this timer with ease of use and simplicity in mind. Default settings shown in the picture.**

**Program Features and Behavior:**
- Two functions: Start/Stop (Toggle) and Reset
- Always stays on top of other programs
- Hotkeys are global and non-blocking
- Easy configuration and auto-saving functionality

**Downsides**
Not cross platform, sorry!

Please feel free to report any bugs and leave any feedback / code reviews.
