I made this timer with ease of use and simplicity in mind. Default settings shown in the picture. Any configuration gets saved automatically without additional user input!

Number 1 = Pause/Resume timer
Number 2 = Reset timer

Please feel free to report any bugs and leave any feedback / code reviews. i am a young college student always trying to improve my coding skills.
